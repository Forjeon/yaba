# yaba
Repo for Yaba (Yet Another Budgeting App), which doubles as my semester project for UVU CS3100 (nice!)



STYLE GUIDE SUGGESTIONS: active voice, second person "you" to address reader, consistent terminology and naming conventions, correct spelling and grammar, 3-5 sentence paragraphs, use of text formatting (bold, lists, visual dividers, headers, whitespace), optimize for skimmability

GOOD README EXAMPLES: FreeCodeCamp, Bootstrap, React,
